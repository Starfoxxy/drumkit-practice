# drumkit-practice
***I made a drumkit using html, css, and javascript, utlizing functions. It displays different parts of a drum for the user to make music using their keyboard.***

***When you hit the corresponding key on your keyboard, it plays the sound associated with the key, along with a short animation where the button pops up to be a bit bigger and applies a yellow border that transitions in and out.***

***I implemented key events, played audio, and listened for the transition end event.***
